			<h2> Charlie </h2>
			<p> Hi, I'm Charlie! I've always loved baking, especially any kind of cake. My favourite cake to bake is Red Velvet Cake. </p>
			<p> I do a lot of home baking to share with friends and family. </p>
			<p> My baking nightmare is getting ingredients wrong, which I once did making a chocolate and guinness cake that ended up burnt on top and raw in the middle. </p>

		<h2> Heledd </h2>
		<p> Hey there, my name's Heledd! I'm always looking for excuses to bake, birthdays, mondays, you name it I'll bake for it! </p>
		<p> My favourite thing to bake is macarons, but my favourite recipe is Chocolate Chip Cookies, so easy to make </p>
		<p> A baking nightmare of mine is one that's so common, but who was I to know that self-raising flour would make <i>that</i> much of a difference, long story short it was the best pancake I ever made </p>
